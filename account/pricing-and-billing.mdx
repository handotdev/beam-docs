### Monitoring compute usage

You can view all the compute you've consumed for the monthly billing period in
the **Plans and Billing** section of the **Settings** page.

You'll see a table broken down by session type:

| Session Type | What it means                                                      |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Inference    | Total hours used for inference, or calling the API on a deployment |
| Job          | Total hours used for scheduled training jobs                       |
| Sandbox      | Total hours used for running code in the sandbox                   |

You can view a granular breakdown of the usage by clicking on a row in the
table.
