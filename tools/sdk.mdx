### Installation

1. Set up a new folder wherever you want and create a virtual env:
   `python3 -m virtualenv .venv`

2. Source virtual env: `source .venv/bin/activate`

3. Install Beam SDK: `pip install beam-sdk`

### Defining a runtime

Your Beam runtime is defined in Python. Running the code below will create an
environment with the compute defined above, build the image, and hot reload as
you work.

```python
beam.App(
	name="testapp",
	cpu=8,
	memory="4Gi",
	gpu=0,
	apt_install=[],
	python_version="python3.8",
	python_packages=["numpy"],
)
```
