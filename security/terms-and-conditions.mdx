3. Updates to the Service. Slai may from time to time make updates to the
   Service as it deems reasonably necessary, and this Agreement shall apply to
   such updated Service. Your continued use of the updated Service indicates
   Your acceptance of the updated.
4. Use of the Services may require the use of certain third party products and
   services (" **Third Party Services**"). Use of any Third Party Services is at
   your sole risk and will be governed by separate terms and conditions,
   separate privacy policies relating to usage of data you may share through the

   policies, and may include separate fees and charges. Slai may display content
   from third parties through the Services or may provide information about or
   links to Third Party Services. Your interactions with any such third parties,
   and any terms, conditions, warranties, or representations associated with
   such interactions, are solely between you and the applicable third parties.
   Slai is not responsible or liable for any loss or damage of any sort incurred
   as the result of any such interactions or as the result of the presence of
   such third-party information made available through the Services.

## REGISTRATION; SUBSCRIPTION AND FEES

1. Registration. To register to use the Service, You must provide Slai with the
   information requested in the registration process, including Your name and
   work email address. You are responsible for all activities that occur under
   Your account; Slai and Slai's affiliates are not responsible for unauthorized
   access to Your account. You will contact Slai immediately if You believe an
   unauthorized third party may be using Your account or if Your account
   information is lost or stolen. You will provide complete and accurate
   information during the registration process and will update it to ensure it
   remains accurate.
2. Some parts of the Services are billed on a Subscription basis. You will be
   billed on a recurring and periodic basis ("Billing Cycle") with payment terms
   as set forth on the applicable order form and/or online checkout. Billing
   cycles are set either on calendar month or annual basis, depending on the
   type of Subscription plan You select when purchasing a Subscription. At the
   end of each Billing Cycle, Your Subscription will automatically renew for
   additional successive periods of equal duration to the initial Subscription
   term unless You cancel it before the end of the then current Subscription
   period. If a free trial period applies to You, Your Subscription will be
   charged upon the expiration of any applicable free trial period.
   Subscriptions canceled prior to the expiration of any trial period will not
   be charged. You may cancel Your Subscription renewal by contacting Slai
   customer support team at [support@slai.io](mailto:support@slai.io), or
   through the account management portal where applicable.
3. A valid payment method is required to process the payment for Your
   Subscription. You shall provide Slai with accurate and complete billing
   information including full name, address, state, zip code, telephone number,
   and a valid payment method information. By submitting such payment
   information, You automatically authorize Slai to charge all Subscription fees
   incurred through Your account to any such payment instruments. Should
   automatic billing fail to occur for any reason, Slai will issue an electronic
   invoice indicating that You must proceed manually, within a certain deadline
   date, with the full payment corresponding to the billing period as indicated
   on the invoice.
4. Slai, in its sole discretion and at any time, may modify the Subscription
   fees for the Subscriptions. Any Subscription fee change will become effective
   at the end of the then-current Billing Cycle. Slai will provide You with a
   reasonable prior notice of any change in Subscription fees to give You an
   opportunity to terminate Your Subscription before such change becomes
   effective. Your continued use of the Services after the Subscription fee
   change comes into effect constitutes Your agreement to pay the modified
   Subscription fee amount.
5. Unless otherwise agreed to in the applicable order form, all fees are payable
   in the currency of the United States through our payment processor
   ("Stripe"). You will be responsible for all taxes resulting from the
   performance of the Service other than taxes on Slai's income. If all or any
   part of any payment owed to Slai under this Agreement is withheld, based upon
   a claim that such withholding is required pursuant to the tax laws of any
   country or its political subdivisions and/or any tax treaty between the U.S.
   and any such country, such payment shall be increased by the amount necessary
   to result in a net payment to Slai of the amounts otherwise payable under
   this Agreement. All fees paid or payable under this Agreement are
   non-refundable and Subscriptions are non-cancelable during the Subscription
   term. Slai may change its fees and payment terms at its discretion.
6. Payments through Stripe. In order to make payments to Slai, You may be
   required to provide Your credit card details to Stripe. Payment processing
   services by Stripe are subject to the Stripe Security Policy, found
   [here](https://stripe.com/docs/security/stripe), and the Stripe Privacy
   Policy, found [here](https://stripe.com/privacy), which Stripe may update
   from time to time. As a condition of Slai enabling payment processing
   services through Stripe, You agree to provide Slai accurate and complete
   information about You and Your business, and You authorize Slai to share it
   and transaction information (exclusive of any credit or debit card numbers,
   details or associated passwords) related to Your use of the payment
   processing services provided by Stripe.
7. Communications. You expressly agree that Slai, or its payment processor, is
   permitted to bill You any applicable fees, any applicable tax and any other
   charges You may incur with Slai in connection with Your use of the Service.
   The fees will be billed to the credit card or other payment account You
   provide in accordance with the billing terms in effect at the time the fees
   are due and payable. You acknowledge and agree that Slai will automatically
   charge Your credit card or other payment account on record with Slai. If
   payment is not received or cannot be charged to Your credit card account for
   any reason, Slai reserves the right to either suspend or terminate Your
   access to the Service and terminate this Agreement. By using the Service, You
   consent to receiving electronic communications from Slai. These electronic
   communications may include notices about applicable fees and charges related
   to the Service and transactional or other information concerning or related
   to the Service. These electronic communications are part of Your relationship
   with Slai and You receive them as part of Your use of the Service. You agree
   that any notices, agreements, disclosures or other communications that we
   send You electronically will satisfy any legal communication requirements,
   including that such communications be in writing.
8. Acceptable Use. In addition to the prohibitions set forth in Section 1(b)
   above, You agree not to, and not to allow third parties to use the Service:
   to violate, or encourage the violation of, the legal rights of others (for
   example, infringing or misappropriate the intellectual property rights of
   others in violation of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act); to engage in,
   promote or encourage illegal activity; for any unlawful, invasive,
   infringing, defamatory or fraudulent purpose (for example, this may include
   phishing, creating a pyramid scheme or mirroring a website); to intentionally
   distribute viruses, worms, Trojan horses, corrupted files, hoaxes, or other
   items of a destructive or deceptive nature; to interfere with the use of the
   Service, or the equipment used to provide the Service, by customers,
   authorized resellers, or other authorized users; to disable, interfere with
   or circumvent any aspect of the Service; to generate, distribute, publish or
   facilitate unsolicited mass email, promotions, advertisements or other
   solicitations ("spam"); or to use the Service, or any interfaces provided
   with the Service in a manner that violates the terms of this Agreement. If
   You become aware of any use or content that is in violation of the foregoing
   Acceptable Use restrictions, You agree to promptly remedy such use or
   content. If You fail to do so, Slai or its providers may suspend or disable
   access to the Service (including Your Data) until You comply.

## CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION

"Confidential Information" means any proprietary information that is marked
"confidential" or "proprietary" or any other similar term or in relation to
which its confidentiality should by its nature be inferred or, if disclosed

of the other party agrees not to use such Confidential Information for any
purpose except as necessary to fulfill its obligations and exercise its rights
under this Agreement. The receiving party shall protect the secrecy of and
prevent disclosure and unauthorized use of the disclosing party's Confidential
Information using the same degree of care that it takes to protect its own
confidential information and in no event shall use less than reasonable care.
The receiving party may disclose the Confidential Information of the disclosing
party if required by judicial or administrative process, provided that the
receiving party first provides to the disclosing party prompt notice of such
required disclosure (to the extent allowed) to enable the disclosing party to
seek a protective order. Upon termination or expiration of this Agreement, the

1. **WARRANTY AND WARRANTY DISCLAIMER.**

   1. Slai warrants that the Service will materially conform to the
      specifications set forth in the applicable Documentation for the duration
      of Your Subscription term. If Slai is unable to correct any reported
      non-conformity with this warranty, Slai may terminate the applicable
      Subscription and as Your sole remedy, You will be entitled to receive a
      pro-rata refund of any prepaid but unused Subscription fees. This warranty
      will not apply if the error or non-conformance was caused by misuse of the
      Service, or third-party hardware, software, or services used in connection
      with the Service.
   2. You should regularly back up Your Data while using the Service. Slai
      PROVIDES THE SERVICE ON AN "AS IS" BASIS. Slai DOES NOT MAKE ANY
      WARRANTIES REGARDING THE PERFORMANCE OF THE SERVICE OR UPTIME OF THE
      SERVICE, OR THAT YOUR USE OF THE SERVICES WILL BE SECURE, UNINTERRUPTED OR
      ERROR FREE, WHETHER EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE. Slai
      EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMS ALL WARRANTIES, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, THE
      IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF NON-INFRINGEMENT OF THIRD PARTY RIGHTS, TITLE,
      MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. Slai HAS NO
      RESPONSIBILITY FOR LOSS OF YOUR DATA OR INABILITY TO USE THE SERVICE FOR
      ANY REASONS, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, IF DUE TO THE ACTS OR
      OMISSIONS OF ITS THIRD PARTY HOSTING PROVIDERS.

### LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.

NEITHER SLAI, ITS AFFILIATES OR THEIR LICENSORS ARE LIABLE FOR SPECIAL,
INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL OR INDIRECT DAMAGES, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION,
LOST PROFITS, LOST SAVINGS, OR DAMAGES ARISING FROM LOSS OF USE, LOSS OF
QUERIES, CONTENT OR DATA OR ANY ACTUAL OR ANTICIPATED DAMAGES, REGARDLESS OF THE
LEGAL THEORY ON WHICH SUCH DAMAGES MAY BE BASED, AND EVEN IF SLAI HAS BEEN
ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. SLAIâ€™S AND SLAIâ€™S AFFILIATES' AND
LICENSORS' AGGREGATE LIABILITY FOR ANY PERMITTED DIRECT DAMAGES UNDER THIS
AGREEMENT WILL BE LIMITED TO THE GREATER OF (i) THE AMOUNT OF ONE HUNDRED
DOLLARS; OR (ii) THE FEES THAT YOU HAVE ACTUALLY PAID OR PAYABLE TO SLAI FOR THE
RELEVANT SERVICES WITHIN THE SIX (6) MONTH PERIOD IMMEDIATELY PRECEDING THE
EVENT GIVING RISE TO THE CLAIM FOR DAMAGES. SECTION 9 ON LIMITATION OF LIABILITY
AND SECTION 8 ABOVE ON WARRANTY DISCLAIMER FAIRLY ALLOCATE THE RISKS IN THIS
AGREEMENT. THIS ALLOCATION IS AN ESSENTIAL ELEMENT OF THE BASIS OF THE BARGAIN
BETWEEN THE PARTIES AND THAT THE LIMITATIONS SPECIFIED IN THIS SECTION 9 SHALL
APPLY NOTWITHSTANDING ANY FAILURE OF THE ESSENTIAL PURPOSE OF THESE TERMS OR ANY
LIMITED REMEDY HEREUNDER.

### INDEMNIFICATION

You will, at Slai's option, defend, indemnify, and hold Slai, Slai's affiliates
and licensors, and each of their respective employees, officers, directors, and
representatives harmless from and against any claims, damages, losses,
liabilities, costs, and expenses (including reasonable legal fees) arising out
of or relating to any third party claim concerning: (a) breach of this Agreement
or violation of applicable law or regulation by You; (b) Your Data or the
combination of Your Data with other applications, content or processes,

third-party rights by Your Data or by the use, development, design, production,
advertising or marketing of Your Data; or (c) the use of the Services. Slai will
promptly notify You of any claim subject to this Section, but Slai's failure to
promptly notify You will only affect Your obligations to the extent that Slai's
failure prejudices Your ability to defend the claim. You may: (a) use counsel of
Your own choosing (subject to Slai's written consent) to defend against any
claim; and (b) settle the claim as You deem appropriate, provided that You
obtain Slai's prior written consent before entering into any settlement.

### GENERAL

1.  1.  Miscellaneous. Slai and You are independent contractors, and neither
        party, nor any of their respective affiliates, is an agent of the other
        for any purpose or has the authority to bind the other. This Agreement
        does not create any third party beneficiary rights in any individual or
        entity that is not a party to this Agreement. You may not assign this
        Agreement, or delegate or sublicense any of Your rights under this
        Agreement, without Slai's prior written consent. Slai may without
        restriction, assign, transfer or delegate this Agreement and any rights
        and obligations hereunder, at its sole discretion, with 30 days prior
        notice. Your right to terminate this Agreement at any time remains
        unaffected. A party's failure to enforce any provision of this Agreement
        will not constitute a present or future waiver of such provision nor
        limit that party's right to enforce such provision at a later time. If
        any portion of this Agreement is held to be invalid or unenforceable,
        the remaining portions of this Agreement will remain in full force and
        effect. In any action or proceeding to enforce rights under this
        Agreement, the prevailing party shall be entitled to recover costs and
        attorneys' fees. 2. Entire Agreement. This Agreement is the entire
        agreement between You and Slai regarding the subject matter of this
        Agreement. This Agreement supersedes all prior or contemporaneous
        representations, understandings, agreements, or communications between
        You and Slai, whether written or verbal, regarding the subject matter of
        this Agreement. 3. Notice. All communications and notices to be made or
        given pursuant to this Agreement must be in English. Slai may provide
        any notice to You under this Agreement by posting a notice in the
        Service or sending a message to the email address associated with Your
        account. You will be deemed to have received any email sent to the email
        address then associated with Your account when Slai sends the email,
        whether or not You actually receive the email. To give Slai notice under
        this Agreement, You must (1) email Slai at legal@slai.io, or (2) send
        Slai Your notice by certified mail, return receipt requested, to Slai at
        1 Broadway 14th Floor, Cambridge MA 02142, Attn: Smartshare.
    2.  Dispute Resolution and Arbitration Agreement and Choice of Law and
        Jurisdiction
    3.  This Dispute Resolution and Arbitration Agreement shall apply if You (i)
        reside in the United States; or (ii) do not reside in the United States,
        but bring any claim against Slai in the United States.
    4.  AGREEMENT TO ARBITRATE. ANY CONTROVERSY OR CLAIM ARISING OUT OF OR
        RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT, OR THE BREACH THEREOF, SHALL BE SETTLED BY
        ARBITRATION ADMINISTERED BY THE AMERICAN ARBITRATION ASSOCIATION IN
        ACCORDANCE WITH ITS COMMERCIAL ARBITRATION RULES, AND JUDGMENT ON THE
        AWARD RENDERED BY THE ARBITRATOR MAY BE ENTERED IN ANY COURT HAVING
        JURISDICTION THEREOF. IF THERE IS A DISPUTE ABOUT WHETHER THIS
        ARBITRATION AGREEMENT CAN BE ENFORCED OR APPLIES TO OUR DISPUTE, YOU AND
        SLAI AGREE THAT THE ARBITRATOR WILL DECIDE THAT ISSUE.
    5.  1. Pre-Arbitration Dispute Resolution and Notification. Prior to
           initiating an arbitration, You and Slai each agree to notify the
           other party of the dispute and attempt to negotiate an informal
           resolution to it first. We will contact You at the email address You
           have provided to us; You can contact Slai's customer service team by
           emailing us at the contact addresses provided on the Site. If after a
           good faith effort to negotiate, one of us feels the dispute has not
           and cannot be resolved informally, the party intending to pursue
           arbitration agrees to notify the other party via email prior to
           initiating the arbitration. In order to initiate arbitration, a claim
           must be filed with the AAA and the written Demand for Arbitration
           (available at
           [www.adr.org](http://www.adr.org/cs/idcplg?IdcService=GET%5FFILE&dDocName=ADRSTAGE2034889&RevisionSelectionMethod=LatestReleased))
           provided to the other party, as specified in the AAA Rules.
        2. Exceptions to Arbitration Agreement. You and Slai each agree that the
           following claims are exceptions to the Arbitration Agreement and will
           be brought in a judicial proceeding in a court of competent
           jurisdiction: (i) Any claim related to actual or threatened
           infringement, misappropriation or violation of a party's copyrights,
           trademarks, trade secrets, patents, or other intellectual property
           rights; (ii) Any claim seeking emergency injunctive relief based on
           exigent circumstances (e.g., imminent danger or commission of a
           crime, hacking, cyber-attack).
        3. Arbitration Rules and Governing Law. This Arbitration Agreement
           evidences a transaction in interstate commerce and thus the Federal
           Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this
           provision. The arbitration will be administered by AAA in accordance
           with the Commercial Arbitration Rules (the " AAA Rules") then in
           effect, except as modified here. The AAA Rules are available at
           [www.adr.org](http://www.adr.org/) or by calling the AAA at
           1â€“800â€“778â€“7879.
        4. Modification to AAA Rules - Arbitration Hearing/Location. You agree
           that any required arbitration hearing will be conducted in the
           English language by one (1) mutually agreed upon arbitrator, at
           Slai's sole and complete discretion, (a) in Delaware or in any other
           location to which You and Slai both agree; (b) via phone or video
           conference; or (c) for any claim or counterclaim under $25,000, by
           solely the submission of documents to the arbitrator.
        5. **JURY TRIAL WAIVER. YOU AND SLAI ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT WE ARE
           EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY AS TO ALL ARBITRABLE
           DISPUTES.**
        6. **NO CLASS ACTIONS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDINGS. YOU AND SLAI
           ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT WE ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO
           PARTICIPATE AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS USER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS
           ACTION LAWSUIT, CLASS-WIDE ARBITRATION, PRIVATE ATTORNEY-GENERAL
           ACTION, OR ANY OTHER REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING AS TO ALL DISPUTES.
           FURTHER, UNLESS YOU AND SLAI BOTH OTHERWISE AGREE IN WRITING, THE
           ARBITRATOR MAY NOT CONSOLIDATE MORE THAN ONE PARTY'S CLAIMS AND MAY
           NOT OTHERWISE PRESIDE OVER ANY FORM OF ANY CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE
           PROCEEDING. IF THIS PARAGRAPH IS HELD UNENFORCEABLE WITH RESPECT TO
           ANY DISPUTE, THEN THE ENTIRETY OF THE ARBITRATION AGREEMENT WILL BE
           DEEMED VOID WITH RESPECT TO SUCH DISPUTE.**
        7. Severability. Except as provided in the immediately preceding
           paragraph, in the event that any portion of this Arbitration
           Agreement is deemed illegal or unenforceable, such provision shall be
           severed and the remainder of the Arbitration Agreement shall be given
           full force and effect.
        8. Changes. Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 3 ("Modification
           of These Terms"), if Slai changes this Section ("Dispute Resolution
           and Arbitration Agreement") after the date You last accepted these
           Terms (or accepted any subsequent changes to these Terms), You may
           reject any such change by sending us written notice (including by
           email) within thirty (30) days of the date such change became
           effective. By rejecting any change, You are agreeing that You will
           arbitrate any Dispute between You and Slai in accordance with the
           provisions of the "Dispute Resolution and Arbitration Agreement"
           section as of the date You last accepted these Terms (or accepted any
           subsequent changes to these Terms).
        9. Choice of Law; Jurisdiction. If You reside in the United States,
           these Terms will be interpreted in accordance with the laws of the
           State of Delaware and the United States of America, without regard to
           conflict-of-law provisions. Judicial proceedings (other than small
           claims actions) that are excluded from the Arbitration Agreement
           above must be brought in state or federal court in Delaware, unless
           we both agree to some other location. You and we both consent to
           venue and personal jurisdiction in Delaware.
2.  Survival. All provisions of this Agreement which by their nature should
    survive termination shall survive termination, including, without
    limitation, accrued payment obligations, ownership provisions, warranty
    disclaimers, indemnity, limitations of liability and dispute resolution.
3.  1. Force Majeure. Slai is not liable for any delay or failure to perform any
       obligation under this Agreement where the delay or failure results from
       any cause beyond Slai's reasonable control, including acts of God, labor
       disputes or other industrial disturbances, systemic electrical,
       telecommunications, or other utility failures, earthquake, storms or
       other elements of nature, blockages, embargoes, riots, acts or orders of
       government, acts of terrorism, or war.
    2. Government Licensees. The Service is a commercial computer software
       program developed solely at private expense. As defined in U.S. Federal
       Acquisition Regulations (FAR) section 2.101 and U.S. Defense Federal
       Acquisition Regulations (DFAR) sections 252.227-7014(a)(1) and
       252.227-7014(a)(5) (or otherwise as applicable to You), the Service
       licensed in this Agreement is deemed to be "commercial items" and
       "commercial computer software" and "commercial computer software
       documentation." Consistent with FAR section 12.212 and DFAR section
       227.7202, (or such other similar provisions as may be applicable to You),
       any use, modification, reproduction, release, performance, display, or
       disclosure of such service commercial item, or service commercial
       computer software, or service commercial documentation by the U.S.
       government (or any agency or contractor thereof) shall be governed solely
       by the terms of this Agreement and shall be prohibited except to the
       extent expressly permitted by the terms of this Agreement.
    3. Changes to the Terms. Slai reserves the right to modify this Agreement at
       any time in accordance with this provision. If we make changes to this
       Agreement, we will post this Agreement on the Slai website. If You
       disagree with the revised Agreement, You may terminate this Agreement
       with immediate effect by following the procedure described in the "Term
       and Termination" section. If You do not terminate Your Agreement before
       the date the revised Agreement becomes effective, Your continued access
       to or use of the Services will constitute acceptance of the revised
       Agreement.
